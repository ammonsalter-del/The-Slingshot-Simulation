# Frequently Asked Questions

## Playing the Game

### How long does a game take?
A typical game takes 45-90 minutes, depending on how carefully you consider each decision. The tutorial adds an additional 5-10 minutes for first-time players.

### Can I save my progress?
The game runs entirely in your browser and does not save progress between sessions. Each playthrough is designed to be completed in a single sitting. If you need to pause, keep the browser tab open—but be aware that refreshing or closing the tab will reset the game.

### Why do I keep failing?
Most players fail on their first few attempts—this is intentional! The game is designed to teach through experience and failure. Common reasons for failure include:
- Running out of cash before completing milestones
- Spreading action points too thin across too many priorities
- Ignoring competitor movements
- Over-investing in research at the expense of commercial progress
- Under-investing in team morale and retention

Each failure teaches something. Try different strategies, founder types, and sectors.

### What's the best strategy?
There is no single "best" strategy—that's part of the learning. Different founder types, sectors, and random events require different approaches. The game rewards adaptive thinking and trade-off management rather than a fixed formula.

### Can I play on mobile?
Yes, but the experience is optimised for desktop or laptop screens. On mobile devices, some interface elements may be cramped. We recommend landscape orientation if playing on a tablet.

### Does the game require an internet connection?
If you download the HTML file from the Releases page, you can play entirely offline. The online version at ai-startup-game.github.io requires an internet connection.

## For Educators

### Can I use this in my course?
Yes! The game is licensed under CC BY-NC-SA 4.0, which means you can freely use it for non-commercial educational purposes. Please provide appropriate attribution (see the Citation section in the README).

### How should I integrate this into my syllabus?
See the [Teaching Guide](docs/AI_Startup_Game_Teaching_Guide.pdf) for detailed lesson plans ranging from single sessions to full course integration. The game works well as:
- An experiential introduction to entrepreneurship concepts
- A discussion catalyst for strategy and innovation topics
- A competitive tournament with reflection assignments
- A capstone activity connecting multiple course themes

### Can I modify the game for my teaching context?
Absolutely. Under the CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 license, you can adapt the game for your needs. Fork the repository, make your changes, and share your adaptations under the same license. We'd love to hear about modifications you create.

### How do I compare student performance?
Currently, the game does not include a centralised tracking system. Students can share their end-game summaries (available as a downloadable PDF) for comparison. A teacher dashboard is on our wishlist for future development—contributions welcome!

### Can I translate the game?
Yes, translations are welcome under the license terms. If you create a translation, please consider contributing it back to the community via the GitHub repository.

## Technical Issues

### The game won't load
Try the following:
1. Use a modern browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, or Edge)
2. Clear your browser cache and reload
3. Disable browser extensions that might interfere (ad blockers, script blockers)
4. Try the offline version by downloading the HTML file directly

### The interface looks broken or elements overlap
This usually indicates a browser compatibility issue. Please:
1. Update your browser to the latest version
2. Try a different browser
3. If on mobile, try landscape orientation or switch to desktop

### I found a bug
Please report it on the [Issues](../../issues) page using the bug report template. Include:
- What you expected to happen
- What actually happened
- Your browser and operating system
- Steps to reproduce the issue

### Audio isn't working
Check that:
1. Your device volume is turned up
2. The in-game sound toggle (speaker icon) is enabled
3. Your browser allows audio playback (some browsers block autoplay)

## Research Use

### Can I use this game in a research study?
Yes, the game can be used for academic research under the license terms. Please cite the game appropriately in any publications. If you're planning experimental research, note that the current version does not include built-in data export or participant tracking—you may need to implement these features yourself or collect data through other means (e.g., screenshots, post-game surveys).

### Is there an API or data export feature?
Not currently. This is a potential area for future development. If you're interested in contributing research-oriented features, please open a discussion on GitHub.

### How can I control for randomness in experiments?
The game includes random events that vary between playthroughs. For controlled experiments, you may need to modify the source code to fix random seeds or disable certain event types. Feel free to fork the repository for this purpose.

## Other Questions

### Who made this?
The game was developed by Ammon Salter, Stefano Baruffaldi, and Federico Bignone as part of an ESRC-funded research project. See the README for full acknowledgments.

### How can I contribute?
See the Contributing section in the README. We welcome bug reports, feature suggestions, code contributions, translations, and adaptations for different teaching contexts.
