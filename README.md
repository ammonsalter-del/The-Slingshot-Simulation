## Overview

The Slingshot places students in the role of an AI startup founder making real strategic decisions under uncertainty. Set in the UK's thriving AI ecosystem in 2026, players experience what it takes to build a billion-dollar company in one of the world's most dynamic startup environments.

Over 3-4 simulated years (12-16 quarters), players must:

- Complete three progressively challenging milestones before running out of cash
- Allocate limited attention (Action Points) across competing priorities
- Navigate the tension between scientific rigour and commercial pressure
- Respond to competitors racing toward the same goals
- Build and retain a team while managing culture and morale
- Make funding decisions that affect control and runway
- Apply for UK innovation grants to secure non-dilutive funding

The game's timeline reflects reality: the average UK AI unicorn reaches billion-dollar status in just 4.8 years (about 19 quarters).

Most players fail on their first attempt—and that's by design. The game teaches through experience, failure, and replay.

## Features

### Ideas for Future Development

There are many exciting directions this game could take. Some possibilities include:

- **New sectors**: Adapt the game for different industries beyond AI—biotech, fintech, cleantech, or traditional sectors

- **Research mode**: Tools for experimental use in research projects, including data export, controlled scenario variations, and participant tracking for academic studies
- **Mobile native app**: Develop a dedicated iOS/Android version optimised for touch interfaces
- **Multiplayer mode**: Allow students to compete directly against each other rather than AI rivals
- **Extended scenarios**: Add post-exit gameplay, IPO paths, or corporate venture capital interactions
- **Accessibility improvements**: Enhanced screen reader support, colour-blind modes, and keyboard navigation
- **Budding entrepreneurs version**: A slimmed down and less complex version targetted at first-year undergraduate and secondary school students (UK - A-Level)
