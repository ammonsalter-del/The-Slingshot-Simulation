## Overview

The AI Startup Game places students in the role of an AI startup founder making real strategic decisions under uncertainty. Over 3-4 simulated years, players must:

- Complete three progressively challenging milestones before running out of cash
- Allocate limited attention (Action Points) across competing priorities
- Navigate the tension between scientific rigour and commercial pressure
- Respond to competitors racing toward the same goals
- Build and retain a team while managing culture and morale
- Make funding decisions that affect control and runway

Most players fail on their first attempt—and that's by design. The game teaches through experience, failure, and replay.

## Features

- **8 AI Sectors**: Healthcare, Robotics, Finance, Creative AI, Cybersecurity, Climate Tech, Legal Tech, Education—each with unique challenges
- **12 Founder Types**: From Academic to Serial Founder to First-Timer, each with different strengths and weaknesses
- **300+ Unique Events**: Realistic scenarios drawn from actual startup experiences
- **3 Rival Companies**: AI-controlled competitors that race you to milestones
- **Multiple Funding Paths**: Bootstrap, angels, accelerators, or venture capital
