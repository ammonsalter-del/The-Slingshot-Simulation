### Submit Code
We welcome pull requests for bug fixes, new features, and improvements. Please:

1. **Fork the repository** and create your branch from `main`
2. **Test your changes** thoroughly in multiple browsers
3. **Follow the existing code style** (the game is written as a single HTML file with embedded CSS and JavaScript)
4. **Write clear commit messages** explaining what and why
5. **Update documentation** if your changes affect how the game works
6. **Submit a pull request** with a clear description of your changes

### Create Adaptations
Under the license, you're free to create your own versions of the game. If you create something interesting (a new sector, a translation, a variant for a different context), please let us know! We'd love to showcase community contributions.

### Improve Documentation
Help us improve the README, FAQ, Teaching Guide, or other documentation. Clear documentation helps everyone.

### Share Your Experience
Using the game in your teaching? We'd love to hear about it. Share your experiences, lesson plans, or student feedback in the Discussions section.

## Development Guidelines

### Code Structure
The game is intentionally built as a single HTML file for maximum portability—it can be downloaded and played offline without any build process or dependencies. Please maintain this architecture unless there's a compelling reason to change it.

### Testing
Before submitting changes, please test:
- Chrome (latest)
- Firefox (latest)
- Safari (latest)
- Edge (latest)
- Mobile browsers (iOS Safari, Chrome for Android) if possible

### Style Guide
- Use clear, descriptive variable and function names
- Comment complex logic
- Keep functions focused and reasonably sized
- Maintain consistent indentation (2 spaces)
- Use British English spelling in user-facing text (to match the existing content)

### Commit Messages
Write clear commit messages that explain what changed and why:
```

- Added 15 new events specific to climate technology startups
- Includes regulatory changes, green funding opportunities, and carbon market dynamics
- Connects to existing milestone system
```
